# Welcome to the Godot OpenVR asset documentation and wiki!

This is still a work in progress, and help/suggestions are welcome of course!

## Getting the Godot OpenVR module

You can either get the asset via the built-in asset library in Godot, or directly by downloading this repository. If you do download the repository directly, make sure to copy the **addons/godot-openvr** folder to your game's **addons** folder.

Lastly, if you want to compile the asset manually, please follow the instructions in module the [README.md](https://github.com/GodotVR/godot_openvr/blob/master/README.md) file.

## Basic use of the Godot OpenVR asset

First, it is recommended to read the [AR/VR Primer](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/vr/vr_primer.html) tutorial on the official Godot documentation website, where the basic VR concepts in Godot are explained.

Next, there is a [starter tutorial](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/vr/vr_starter_tutorial/vr_starter_tutorial_part_one.html) there as well. If you prefer video, Bastiaan Olij has a good [tutorial of the godot-openvr asset](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=267dRjEYliU) on Youtube.
