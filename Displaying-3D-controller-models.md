OpenVR carries 3D models of controllers, base stations and HMDs. Wherever possible these models reflect the actual physical appearance of the devices.

In Godot OpenVR the OpenVRRenderModel class can be used to load these models into your game or application to be displayed to the user.

Implementation of VR controllers is created in `addons/godot-openvr/scenes/ovr_controller.tscn`. Use this scene as your ARVRController and it should work out of the box.
